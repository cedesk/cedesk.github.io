The [Concurrent Engineering Design Laboratory](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/research/labs/concurrent-engineering-design-laboratory/) (CEDL) provides to the Space CREI and other centers at Skoltech the capacity of a concurrent engineering environment that is able to support conceptual design studies, and systems architecture research and related education activities at Skoltech. The purpose of concurrent engineering is to perform conceptual studies more efficiently and more exhaustively, at a fraction of the time and cost involved in traditional sequential design studies.

CEDL is developed by the Strategic Innovation Research Group at Skoltech, led by PI Prof. Alessandro Golkar. With the CEDL, Skoltech is developing a center that is unique in its kind. The facility is the first concurrent engineering center in the Russian Federation. CEDL strives to push forward the state of the art, developing concurrent engineering approaches in all fields of interest of the Institute, with particular emphasis for Space applications.

CEDL is a 300 sqm facility able to host design studies with multidisciplinary teams of up to 60 people. The laboratory is divided into a main design room and two breakout rooms to allow parallelization of design work. The design room is equipped with state of the art tools including a 8m x 1.7m high definition 3D videowall, 4 84‚Äù touch LCD screens, and interactive design seats. The facility is operated with a dedicated wireless system and a cloud infrastructure where 3 multicore servers host a comprehensive suite of specialist software used in the typical disciplines for the preliminary design of a space mission. CEDL hosts research in concurrent engineering theory, as well as education programs for Skoltech students and short professional courses. The facility is also available for external studies and for professional training on the use of concurrent engineering in systems design. While the facility is hosted by the Space Center, it is available to other research centers at the Institute and it aims at extending its disciplinary expertise to other domains beyond Space, being Energy the next immediate interest for development.

**(Some of the) Possible Activities in CEDL:** Project appraisals, Model-based Systems Engineering, Systems Architecture, Preliminary Design Studies of Complex Engineering Systems and Infrastructure, Integrated Technical and Economic assessment of engineering projects, Multidisciplinary optimization, stakeholder engagement analysis.

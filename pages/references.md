### SECESA 2016

CEDESK was first presented on the [Systems Engineering and Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/CDF/Systems_and_Concurrent_Engineering_for_Space_Applications_SECESA_2016) conference held 5-7 October 2016 in Madrid.

Presentation slides available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318641101_A_coordination_method_for_concurrent_design_and_a_collaboration_tool_for_parametric_system_models).

Our successful presentation was covered by [Skoltech News](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/2016/11/the-paper-of-skoltech-phd-student-is-one-of-the-top-10-at-the-secesa-2016-conference-of-the-european-space-agency/)

### INCOSE Symposium 2016

We have developed a concurrent design laboratory at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology where CEDESK is being developed. Our learnings from the process were presented at the [INCOSE Symosium 2016](http://www.incose.org/symp2016/home).

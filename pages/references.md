### CERA 2017

The tool CEDESK and a processguide for concurrent conceptual design is descibed in a paper in a special issue of the [Journal on Concurrent Engineering Research and Applications](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/cer).

Knoll, Dominik, and Alessandro Golkar. 2016. “A Coordination Method for Concurrent Design and a Collaboration Tool for Parametric System Models.” In SECESA 2016, Madrid, 1–11. [doi:10.1177/1063293X17732374](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1063293X17732374).

The release of CEDESK as open source software was covered by [Skoltech News](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/2017/08/skoltech-research-team-releases-cutting-edge-concurrent-engineering-software/).

### PLM Conference 2017

The data structures and conceptual modeling approach was presented at the Annual [PLM Conference](http://www.plm-conference.org), in Seville, July 2017.

Fortin, Clément, Grant Mcsorley, Dominik Knoll, Alessandro Golkar, and Ralina Tsykunova. 2017. “Study of Data Structures and Tools for the Concurrent Conceptual Design of Complex Space Systems.” In IFIP 14th International Conference on Product Lifecycle Management 9-12 July 2017, Seville, Spain. Seville.

### SECESA 2016

CEDESK was first presented on the [Systems Engineering and Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/CDF/Systems_and_Concurrent_Engineering_for_Space_Applications_SECESA_2016) conference held 5-7 October 2016 in Madrid.

Presentation slides available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318641101_A_coordination_method_for_concurrent_design_and_a_collaboration_tool_for_parametric_system_models).

Our successful presentation was covered by [Skoltech News](http://www.skoltech.ru/en/2016/11/the-paper-of-skoltech-phd-student-is-one-of-the-top-10-at-the-secesa-2016-conference-of-the-european-space-agency/).

### INCOSE Symposium 2016

We have developed a concurrent design laboratory at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology where CEDESK is being developed. Our learnings from the process were presented at the [INCOSE Symosium 2016](http://www.incose.org/symp2016/home).

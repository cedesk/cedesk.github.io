  systems. This type of tool is also known as data exchange for concurrent engineering studies.<br/><br/>
  Multidisciplinary design teams can use CEDESK to facilitate their work together by building shared parametric models
  of their system of interest.'

         CEDESK does not duplicate the functionality of existing engineering tools, but rather interconnects existing 
         tools to provide fast and easy-to-use integration among engineering disciplines.

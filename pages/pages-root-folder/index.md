  More complete <a href="/documents/CEDESK-documentation.pdf">documentation can be found here</a>.<br/>
  Multidisciplinary design teams can use CEDESK to facilitate their work together by building shared parametric models of their system of interest.'

         </ul>
         CEDESK does not duplicate the functionality of existing engineering tools, but rather interconnects existing tools to provide fast and easy-to-use integration among engineering disciplines.

  text: 'CEDESK is a tool to facilitate co-located collaborative model-based conceptual design for complex engineering 
  systems. This type of tool is also known as data exchange for concurrent engineering studies.<br/><br/>
  Multidisciplinary design teams can use CEDESK to facilitate their work together by building shared parametric models
  of their system of interest.'

         </ul>
         CEDESK does not duplicate the functionality of existing engineering tools, but rather interconnects existing 
         tools to provide fast and easy-to-use integration among engineering disciplines.

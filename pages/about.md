## General Concept

CEDESK is a tool to facilitate co-located collaborative model-based conceptual design for complex engineering systems. This type of tool is also known as data exchange for concurrent engineering studies.

More complete [documentation can be found here](/documents/CEDESK-documentation.pdf).

Multidisciplinary design teams can use CEDESK to facilitate their work together by building shared parametric models of their system of interest.

## Features

* Conceptual Design - CEDESK supports experts in iterative design by exchanging data between various disciplines and types of models, iterating the design process until a feasible design is consolidated.
* Shared Repository - CEDESK stores interconnected parametric models and their historical evolution during design studies.
* Concurrent work - CEDESK facilitates synchronization of simultaneous work.
* Interactive Analytics - CEDESK supports decision making during design studies with analytic tools such as the Design Structure Matrix for interdependencies and Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration.

Each discipline expert uses disciplinary tools to define parts of their system of interest. A common system model connects those domain-specific tools through design parameters defining system interdependencies. 

CEDESK does not duplicate the functionality of existing engineering tools, but rather interconnects existing tools to provide fast and easy-to-use integration among engineering disciplines.

The software is developed at the [Concurrent Engineering Design Laboratory](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/research/labs/concurrent-engineering-design-laboratory/), which is part of [Space Center](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/) of [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.skoltech.ru).

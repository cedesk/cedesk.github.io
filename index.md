## General Concept

CEDESK is a tool to facilitate co-located collaborative model-based conceptual design for complex engineering systems. This type of tool is also known as data exchange for concurrent engineering studies.

Multidisciplinary design teams can use CEDESK to facilitate their work together by building shared parametric models of their system of interest.

## Features

* Conceptual Design - CEDESK supports experts in iterative design by exchanging data between various disciplines and types of models, iterating the design process until a feasible design is consolidated.
* Shared Repository - CEDESK stores interconnected parametric models and their historical evolution during design studies.
* Concurrent work - CEDESK facilitates synchronization of simultaneous work.
* Interactive Analytics - CEDESK supports decision making during design studies with analytic tools such as the Design Structure Matrix for interdependencies and Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration.

o define parts of their system of interest. A common system model connects those domain-specific tools through design parameters defining system interdependencies. 

CEDESK does not duplicate the functionality of existing engineering tools, but rather interconnects existing tools to provide fast and easy-to-use integration among engineering disciplines.

The software is developed at the [Concurrent Engineering Design Laboratory](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/research/labs/concurrent-engineering-design-laboratory/), which is part of [Space Center](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/) of [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.skoltech.ru).

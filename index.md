## General Concept

CEDESK is a tool to facilitate co-located collaborative model based conceptual design for space missions and complex systems. Multidisciplinary teams of engineers and scientists can use it for working together with a shared parametric model of any type of system.

## Features

* **conceptual design** - supports the team in iterative design by exchanging data between various disciplines and types of models, and guiding the * iterative process until a the design is consolidated.
* **shared repository** - storage of system model including itâ€™s history.
* **concurrent work** - facilitate synchronization of simultaneous work.
* **interactive analytics** (Design Structure Matrix, Multi-Attribute Tradespaces) to support the decision making.

Each discipline expert uses specific tools to elaborate on aspects or parts of the system. These domain specific models can be arbitrary complex and use different specialized tools to work with them, whereas the common system model contains those design parameters through which the parts are interconnected/interdependent.
A goal in the development of the data exchange is not to duplicate functionality of engineering tools, but rather interconnect existing ones in a way to provide fast and easy-to-use integration.

The software is developed at the [Concurrent Engineering Design Laboratory](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/research/labs/concurrent-engineering-design-laboratory/), which is part of [Space Center](http://crei.skoltech.ru/space/) of [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.skoltech.ru).
